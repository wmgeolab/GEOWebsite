		<p>The Global Education Observatory (GEO) was formed out of</p>
		<ul>
			<li>CMS
				<ul>
					<li>It started in 2011 as an experimental partnership project with the Department of Education along the
						advocacy for access to information and social accountability.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>as a WM team in the geoLab</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In its current form, GEO is working to build and analyze a public dataset of global education data. Team members in
			the William & Mary geoLab find and catalog school-level education data for countries around the world to build an
			extensive database. Team members also analyze the education data that has been collected to gain a better
			understanding of education systems. GEO aims to continuously improve the quality of education services by bringing
			the participation of citizens and communities into the governance of public schools around the world.
